# Sample parameter file for ScatNet 
# ---------------------------------
#
# This file uses YAML (https://yaml.org) markup for defining the
# parameters of any run. It uses the PYAML python library (https://pyyaml.org) 
# in order to conver every entry here into python objects (dict, list, ...).
#
# According to the doc of PYAML, all the sections here are dictionaries
# that are feed to the different functions in the main code. Please
# refer to the use of these arguments in the main.py script, or in the
# routines used by main.py in the scatnetflex package.

# Logging level
# -------------
#   Passed to the logging function directly.
#   Possible levels are: INFO, DEBUG, WARNING, ERROR and CRITICAL.
#   For more information, please refer to 
#   https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html
logging: 
    level: INFO

# Dealing with data 
# -----------------
#   Used by the "reader" routine from scatnetflex/data.py.
#   The batch processing allows for faster computation. The batch size is the
#   number of random examples of data (of size patch_shape) that should be 
#   given at the same time for one iteration. The patch shape should be designed
#   in order to be way bigger than the window size, but to allow the data to
#   fit into the GPU memory.

# Scattering netowrk architecture
# ----------------------------------
#   These are the keyword arguments of the __init__ method of the
#   ScatteringLayer class defined in scatnetflex/layer.py.
layers:
    # Layer-dedicated arguments
    j: [4, 6, 8]
    q: [8, 2, 1]
    k: 7
    pooling_type: average
    decimation: 4
    pooling: 1024

    # Filter-dedicated keyword arguments
    learn_scales: False
    learn_knots: False
    learn_filters: True
    hilbert: True

# Parent normalization arguments
# ------------------------------
#   Define the division regularizer with "eps_norm"
#   and the logarithm regularizer with "eps_log".
eps_norm: 0.001
eps_log: 0.0001

# Stochastic gradient descent
# ---------------------------
# Those values must be cross-validated once. The number of epochs
# is the total number of iteration, and the rate is the delta step
# used in the gradient descent on the Jacobian matrix in otrder to
# perform the gradient descent.
learning:
    epochs: 3
    rate: 0.001

# Latent space dimension
# ----------------------
#   The number of components are the dimension of the low-dimension space.
pca:
    n_components: 5

# Gaussian mixture model
# -----------------------
# GMM: These parameters are fixed for now.
# GMM_INIT: the number of components are the number of clusters to look
# for at the first epoch. The other parameters are the ones given to
# the sklearn.mixture.GaussianMixture() object.
gmm:

# Output options
# --------------
# This defines the place where the results are stores.
# A directory with the name of the run is created, and all the results 
# stored there. A new run file will create a new directory.
